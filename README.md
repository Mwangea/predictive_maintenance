# Predictive Maintenance in Manufacturing

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predictive maintenance in manufacturing. The goal is to predict equipment failures, allowing for proactive maintenance and reducing downtime.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes sensor data from manufacturing equipment and historical maintenance records.

## Usage

1. **Upload Dataset**: Upload the dataset (CSV file) using the provided Jupyter Notebook.

2. **Preprocessing**: The notebook includes preprocessing steps, such as handling missing data and outliers.

3. **Model Development**: A Random Forest Classifier is used for predicting equipment failures based on features like air temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear.

4. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Files

- `predictive_maintenance.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow.
- `predictive_maintenance.csv`: Sample dataset.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mwangea/predictive_maintenance.git
   cd predictive_maintenance
